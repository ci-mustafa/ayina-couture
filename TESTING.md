### Responsiveness Testing
To ensure responsiveness and adaptability, the deployed website was thoroughly tested across a range of devices and screen sizes. Developer Tools were used to simulate various screen dimensions, allowing for an in-depth review of the websiteâ€™s performance on different devices. Bootstrap classes and media queries were applied strategically to preserve both the design and functionality, guaranteeing a consistent and user-friendly experience on all platforms. This approach ensures that the website remains visually appealing and fully operational, regardless of the device used.

### Browser Compatibility Testing

The project was tested on Chrome and Microsoft Edge web browsers to check for compatibility issues and ensure it functions as expected across all of them. This testing process guarantees a smooth and consistent user experience, regardless of the browser used.

### Device Testing
Device testing was conducted on a variety of phone models, including Samsung Galaxy A13, iPhone 14 pro max, iPhone 15 pro and iphone 16. The assistance of family members and friends was sought to perform the testing. This comprehensive approach ensured that the website was thoroughly evaluated on different devices and platforms, contributing to a more robust and user-friendly final product.

### Code Validation 
All code was validated using industry-standard tools specific to each programming language to ensure compliance with best practices, readability, and efficiency. This process helped identify and resolve syntax errors, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues.

#### HTML Validation
I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.
