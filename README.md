## **Agile Planning**

Ayina Couture followed an Agile development approach, ensuring a user-centric and iterative process. The project was structured around user stories, each carefully planned and assigned to specific iterations.
To streamline development efforts, user stories were classified into two priority levels:

- Must-Have – Core functionalities essential for the website to operate efficiently.
- Nice-to-Have – Additional features that enhance user experience but are not critical for the initial launch.

## Fundamental Structure

### Wireframes

- To streamline the website's design process, I created detailed wireframes for each page, ensuring a user-friendly and responsive layout. Following best practices, wireframes were designed for both mobile and desktop dimensions to optimize the user experience across all devices.
I designed all the pages using Balsamiq, ensuring a structured layout and intuitive user experience. To provide insights into the design process and technology choices, I have included some of these wireframes in this README file. These wireframes illustrate the key views, such as Home, Login, Logout, Products, Product Detail, Cart, and Checkout, offering a clear visual reference for the development approach.

### Database Schema

- I created an entity relationship diagram using  [Drawsql.app](https://drawsql.app/). This allowed me to visually represent the connections between my data structures and streamlined the development process significantly. Now, I have a visual guide, making it much easier to understand and interact with my data.
