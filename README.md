## **Agile Planning**

Ayina Couture followed an Agile development approach, ensuring a user-centric and iterative process. The project was structured around user stories, each carefully planned and assigned to specific iterations.
To streamline development efforts, user stories were classified into two priority levels:

- Must-Have – Core functionalities essential for the website to operate efficiently.
- Nice-to-Have – Additional features that enhance user experience but are not critical for the initial launch.

## Fundamental Structure

### Wireframes

- To streamline the website's design process, I created detailed wireframes for each page, ensuring a user-friendly and responsive layout. Following best practices, wireframes were designed for both mobile and desktop dimensions to optimize the user experience across all devices. I utilized [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to develop these wireframes, covering key views such as Home, Login, Logout, Products, Product detail, Cart and Checkout. These visual blueprints provided a clear structure for the site's layout and functionality, guiding the development process effectively.
